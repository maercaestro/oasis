## üìã IMPROVEMENT AREAS & TO-DO LIST

### üé® FRONTEND IMPROVEMENTS

#### 1. Data Editor UI Enhancement
**Priority**: High | **Estimated Days**: 3-4 days
**Current Issue**: The DataEditor component (2566 lines) has poor UX and visual design

**Specific Tasks**:
- [ ] **Redesign form layouts** (1 day)
  - Replace basic inputs with modern styled components
  - Add proper validation feedback
  - Implement consistent spacing and typography
- [ ] **Add tabbed interface improvements** (1 day)
  - Better tab navigation with icons
  - Loading states for data switching
  - Breadcrumb navigation for nested data
- [ ] **Fix data persistence issues** (1-2 days)
  - Resolve cookie/state update problems
  - Implement proper error handling for failed saves
  - Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

#### 2. Number Input Behavior Fix ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: Medium | **Estimated Days**: 1-2 days
**Issue**: Number inputs displayed "0" when empty, causing poor UX where users couldn't clear fields properly

**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] **Fixed all number input patterns** (1 day)
  - Changed `value={field || 0}` to `value={field || ''}` in all 18 instances
  - Added utility functions `getNumberInputValue()` and `parseNumberInput()`
  - Fixed inputs across all sections: vessels, plants, crudes, recipes, routes, vessel types, parcels, requirements
- [x] **Implemented proper empty state handling** 
  - Empty inputs now show truly empty instead of "0"
  - Backend processing still receives valid numbers via `|| 0` fallback in onChange handlers
  - Users can now clear fields and enter new values without "0" interference

#### 3. Feedstock Sections Ocean Theme Styling ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: Low | **Estimated Days**: 1 day
**Issue**: Feedstock parcels and requirements sections used basic slate colors instead of the ocean theme used throughout OASIS

**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] **Updated Feedstock Parcels styling** (0.5 day)
  - Changed "Add New Parcel" button to ocean gradient styling
  - Updated table styling with ocean theme colors: `bg-[#88BDBC]/20`, `text-[#254E58]`, `border-[#88BDBC]/30`
  - Updated input fields with ocean border colors and focus states
  - Added hover effects with ocean theme colors
- [x] **Updated Feedstock Requirements styling** (0.5 day)
  - Changed "Add New Requirement" and "Add First Requirement" buttons to ocean gradient
  - Updated table headers and body styling to match ocean theme
  - Updated all input fields and select dropdowns with ocean border colors
  - Enhanced focus states with ocean theme colors
- [x] **Updated info panels** 
  - Changed blue info panels to ocean theme: `bg-[#88BDBC]/10`, `border-[#88BDBC]/30`, `text-[#254E58]`
  - Updated icon colors to match ocean theme

#### 4. Plant Data Section Ocean Theme Styling ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: Low | **Estimated Days**: 0.5 day
**Issue**: Plant data section needed ocean theme styling to match feedstock sections

**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] **Updated PlantDataEditor number inputs** (0.5 day)
  - Fixed number input behavior: changed `value={field || 0}` to `value={field || ''}` for capacity, base_crude_capacity, and max_inventory
  - Maintained existing ocean theme styling (already properly implemented)
  - Ensured consistency with other sections for empty field handling

#### 5. Chatbox Layout & Scrolling Optimization ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Priority**: High | **Estimated Days**: 1 day
**Issue**: Chat interface had layout and scrolling problems affecting user experience

**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] **Increased chatbox width** (0.25 day)
  - Changed chatbox area from 25% to 30% of screen width
  - Adjusted main content area from 75% to 70% to accommodate larger chatbox
  - Maintained responsive layout proportions
- [x] **Enhanced input area design** (0.25 day)
  - Made input area more compact with reduced padding (p-4 to p-3)
  - Converted single-line input to multi-line textarea for better typing experience
  - Added smart Enter behavior: Enter=send message, Shift+Enter=new line
  - Set textarea constraints: 40px min height, 80px max height
- [x] **Fixed scrolling functionality** (0.5 day)
  - **Root container**: Removed conflicting overflow settings, added proper height constraints
  - **App.jsx container**: Added `min-h-0` and `flex-1` wrapper for chatbox
  - **Messages area**: Optimized as primary scrollable container with `flex-1 overflow-y-auto`
  - **Header/Input**: Added `flex-shrink-0` to prevent shrinking and maintain fixed heights
  - **Padding optimization**: Moved padding inside scrollable area for better scroll behavior
- [x] **Preserved all functionality**
  - Maintained AI streaming responses and auto-scroll behavior
  - Kept loading states and function execution displays
  - Preserved ocean theme styling and animations

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Layout hierarchy**: Root ‚Üí Header (fixed) ‚Üí Messages (scrollable) ‚Üí Input (fixed)
- **Flexbox structure**: `flex-col h-full` with proper `min-h-0` constraints
- **Scrolling**: Single scrollable container in messages area prevents conflicts
- **Auto-scroll**: `messagesEndRef.scrollIntoView()` works seamlessly with new layout

#### 6. Schedule Edit Page Separation
**Priority**: Medium | **Estimated Days**: 2-3 days
